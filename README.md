## Project Overview

This is my first project with the `JavaScript Programming Language`

and I created a story with my project hope you will like it.

`Riva` works in `zoo` and she loves to `count animals` in zoo and sometimes `she forgets the counting` of animals, and each time she forgets the counting she `start counting from zero`. and that's why for `helpng her in her work` I created this `Animal Counter App` hope this will make her job easy.

## What I learned

- Basics of `JavaScript`
- `Numbers` and `Strings`
- Basics of `Functions`
- how to use `getElementById`
- `innertext` and `textContent`
